🚀 ETLModule: The Data Whisperer

Welcome to ETLModule, your friendly neighborhood data wrangler! Whether you're extracting, transforming, or loading, this module's got your back—with some Vue magic and Kafka-powered vibes.

🛠️ Setup Guide
Grab a coffee ☕ and let's get you up and running!

1. 📦 Install Vite & Vue Globally
These two are the dynamic duo of frontend bliss. Install them globally:
    npm install -g vite vue

2. 🧙‍♂️ Install TypeScript
Because typing isn’t just for writers:
    npm install typescript --save-dev
Or go global if you're feeling fancy:
    npm install -g typescript

3. 🏃‍♀️ Run the Dev Server
Time to kick off your local playground:
    npm run dev
This spins up Vite and gets Vue dancing. Expect some blazing-fast HMR!

4. 🎧 Fire Up Kafka (a.k.a. Let the data rave begin!)

Our ETL engine loves a bit of Kafka drama. Here’s how to throw the perfect message party:

🎬 From the ETL-Project root directory (and yep, make sure Docker Desktop is doing its thing):

    docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d

🎉 Wait 5-10 seconds while Kafka wakes up, sip on some coffee while you wait.

🪄 Create your topics like a data wizard:

    .\create-topics.ps1

🚦 Start your test source — for example:

    TestSourceApi

🧩 Now spin up the full ETL experience (yes, all of them!):

- ExtractAPI
- Transform
- Load
- ETLConfigAPI

It's like the Avengers, but for data!
